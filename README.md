#  CIFAR-10: Comparing MLP and CNN

## Project Overview

This project compares two neural network approaches for image classification on the **CIFAR-10** dataset:
- Multilayer Perceptron (**MLP**)
- Convolutional Neural Network (**CNN**)

The main goal is to demonstrate how using convolutional layers significantly boosts performance compared to a plain fully-connected network.  
The project also includes visualizations of convolutional filters, feature maps (activations), and a confusion matrix for the CNN.

## ðŸ¤” Key Takeaways

- **MLP** is not well suited for image recognition tasks, as it does not capture spatial dependencies.
- **CNN** significantly improves accuracy by leveraging local patterns in images.
- Visualizing filters and activations helps to understand what the network is learning.
